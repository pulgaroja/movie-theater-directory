This project was created as a Code Challenge for Rockstar Coders. Built using `create-react-app` and "The Movie DB" free API service.

To keep the code light and simple it's build using custom CSS and simple Functional React components. Although I love SCSS, I'm opting to use vanilla CSS to restrain from adding pre-processors or additional packages to a minimum (as per code challenge instructions).

Ok well, that's all fine and nice but let's get to the good stuff, how do I run this puppy? It's simple, just follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and cd into this project
2. Run the following command to install the project dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Once it's done, you're all set to run it locally, write out this command: `yarn start`

This will build and run the React project, once it's finished compiling it will open a browser window with `http://localhost:3000` as it's location and load the app.

I've added a Prettier config file which helps me keep my code looking just the way I like it, however it's also a great tool in cases where the required standards collide with personal preferences as it ensures the correct format is saved.
